Terminal
    .   refers to the current directory
    ..  refers to the previous directory
    cd ~ takes you back to root
    cd does the same thing
    mkdir dirName   makes a new directory (folder)
    rm -rf recursive-force remove. Wipes everything.    requires an argument
    rmdir   removes an empty directory
    .fileName will make it hidden

Git
    Is for version control
    Instead of simply overwriting the new file, it tracks the previous versions.
    Has 3 states
        Not yet Staged                  run git init in the directory to make it a git repository
        Staged and ready to commit      git add fileName to stage
        Committed                       git commit -m "message" commits everything by pushing it to github.

        git status  details the status of the different files
        if you forget to write the comment, you might need :q to back out of the subsequent screen.

        cloning a repository initiates git automatically
    git pull    pulls down the code from git. Uses what is called a remote.

Github
    Is a code hosting platform.
    You can push the versions of code up to Github, and then get them back later from Github even if you aren't on the original machine.

    Creating a repository



Live server
    in terminal run     live-server
        control click on the link
            click "Click Here" to run the spec tracker.


//declaration vs expression

function sayhi() {
return "This is a declaration"
}

var myFunc = function(){
return "This is an expression"
}

var myArrow = () =>{
    return "Arrow functions are ALWAYS expressions; NEVER declarations"
}

When data is passed into a function, it is considered an argument.

Running a function name followed by parenthesis calls the function.
Calling a function as an argument will execute the return value as the argument.

Objects
    Accessing values.       var obj ={num:1,num2:2}
        Dot notation        obj.num     >>  1       objectName.key      >>  value
        Bracket notation    obj["num2"] >>  2       bracket notation requires that the key be written as a string.

Arrays
    Adding to arrays.
        arr.push(element)       adds the element to the end of arr.
        arr.unshift(element)    adds the element to the front of arr.

Callbacks
    setTimeout(function, miliseconds);  invokes function after the amount of miliseconds.
    callbacks are functions that are passed into other functions.

While vs do while.
    While checks the condition first.

Arrays
    Any value can be stored in an array.
        Values are accessed with arrayName[indexNumber]    
    Unshift and push both return the new length of the array.

    for loops can itereate through an array backwards by starting at array.length -1. Essenstially backwards of the normal method.
        for (let i=arr.length-1;i>=0;i--){}

If statements
    use three words:    if,  else if, or else.
        if(condition){action}
        else if(condition){action}
        else{action} 

        Nesting more than one if could result in all of them performing their action.
        Using else instead of else if will break the nesting and stop the function.



Objects
    Any value can be stored
    Exist as key:value pairs. Also known as properties.
    Alwayys use valid variable names for the keys.
    Keys are technically strings


    2 ways to access.
        Bracket notation
            objName["key"] >> value
        Dot notation
            objName.key >> value

        Typically should use dot.

    Can add properties by setting a new object key equal to a value.
        objName.newKey = newVal

    You can nest objects in arrays or objects and vice versa or more levels.
        Always go biggest to smallest. Left to right.


Ternary
    condition ? actionIfCondition : actionElse
    Works like an if else statement.
    The : is like a teeter-totter.


typeof 
    typeof variable
        will return the data type of what is passed in.
        
        typeof NaN >> number
        typeof null >> object
        typeof functionName >> Function
        typeof functionName() >> dataType of the return of the function.


Callbacks
    A callback is a function that is passed into another function as an argument.
    
    WHY?
        DRY code means you don't repeat yourself. With callbacks you only have to program the function once and then just invoke it.

    Event Listeners - can respond to things like a key press or a button click.

    Asynchronous Processes
        JavaScript is single threaded so it's easy to get stuck waiting for things.
        setTimeout(function(){}, miliseconds)
            will execute the function when the miliseconds have passed.


Alert
    alert(displayedAlert)
        when the page loads, it will display displayedAlert

Strings
    split()     str.split("splitHere")
        splits the string str at the points indicated by splitHere and puts them into an array.
        Default does nothing.
        Returns the new array.
    join()      arr.join("betweenElements")
        concatenates the elements of an array into a single string, placing betweenElements between each one. 
        Default is a single comma.
            arrOfFruitNames.join() >> the same fruit names as a single string, no spaces, but commas.
        returns the string
    toUppersCase()
    toLowerCase()

    template string
        created with backticks(the non-shifted tilde) instead of quotes.
        you can concatenate variables using ${variable}


Array Methods
    .filter()
        is looking for a truthy or falsy from the cb function to decide if it is going to add the new element.

    .reduce()
        takes in a callback function
        4 parameters
            current accumulation
            current element
            current index
            the whole array
    


Objects
    delete
        works similarly to the return statement
        only functions on object properties.
        also only one at a time.

    window
        everything we declare is techically an element in the window object.

    for in loop
        for(let key in objName){action}
            Iterates through every element in an objName
            has to use bracket notation for the key.

    copying 
        objects can't be copied like regulara variables
            let num1=5
            let num2=num1
                Would not work with objects.
        Object.assign({}, objToCopy);
            allows you to copy an existing object.
            let objCopy = Object.assign({}, objToCopy)
                objCopy will be an exact replica of objToCopy
                adding a new property into the curly braces will add it to the beginning of the new object.

    Destructuring
        let {propertyName} = objName;
            creates a variable of same name as the property with the value equal to that of the property in objName

        can be done with an array as well, but isn't very common.
            let [] = arrName
                requires a valid variable name in []
                can "skip" elements by writing commas.

    Function to generate objects.
        Extremely usefule for something like user logins.
        function userCreator(name, age, email){
            let newUser ={
                name: name,
                age: age,
                email
            }
        }
            in a new object, you can create a property with just a variable name ES6.
                will create the property with that name
                will give it the value the variable had.

    Classes
        Convention: names are always capitalized.
        Are technically objects.
        Can use constructors which are functino for generating objects.
        Can contain methods that do not require the function keyword.
            They will be built into the generated objects.
        Using this makes it refer back to itself.    
            class UserCreator {
                constructor(name, age, email) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.age = age;
                    this.email = email;
                }
            }

            constructor is specifically there to generate objects.
            this is a special variable like a keyword
            new  is a keyword
